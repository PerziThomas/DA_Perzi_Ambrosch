# Summary
\fancyfoot[L]{Ambrosch/Perzi}
The developed full stack geofencing application is a new usable module for the ilogs Drivebox product. The initially discussed features and requirements have all been fulfilled and have been implemented, in some cases even further than the original project task defined. The product owners were highly satisfied with the resulting product, immediately passing it onto the main development team to integrate it into the main Drivebox application. 

Working on the application has given us the opportunity to learn new frameworks and technologies in a professional and practical environment. Getting to know these technologies by implementing them in a project has provided us with the best possible experience to be gained with them, such as creating a full ASP.NET Core server from scratch with only the documentation provided by Microsoft. This alongside implementing technologies and techniques that were covered during out education made it a truly valuable experience.

Problems that occurred during the development phases could all be resolved by either sitting down and tackling it yourself, or with the help of a coworker. The general working environment has been very welcoming and motivating toward us. Occasional difficulties arose due to communication errors from the product owners towards us, but these could all be resolved in further meetings. Framework specific technical problems were resolved thanks to the generous support of project maintainers of the libraries in question on GitHub.

All in all, the internship has been a great success on a personal and technical level. The application was developed to the fullest satisfaction of the product owners, and we had the opportunity to further develop our skills. Finally, this thesis serves as the documentation of the creation and development of the geofencing application project.
