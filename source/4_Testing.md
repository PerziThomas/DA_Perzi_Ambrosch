# Testing
This chapter describes the use of common testing techniques and methods as well as the technologies used during development
to ensure a stable and secure application which is ready to be used by the company clients. \\
Testing is an important aspect of every piece of software, as it ensures the functionality, security and the coverage
of the implemented code. Software testing is generally organised into two categories, functional and non-functional testing,
with both types being used to test the DriveBox Geofencing software. [@testingTypes]


## Functional Testing
There are several ways to test a piece of software on its functionality, with Unit- and Integration-Testing being the most
broadly used examples of these, with those methods also being used to test the back- and frontend parts of the Geofencing
application.


### REST Endpoint Functionality
Web endpoints using the REST architecture were tested using \textbf{xUnit} as a general testing framework and the \textbf{Microsoft ASP.NET CoreMVC Testing package} to send Web Requests to the server. 
These tools were used due to the backend being written in C# on top of the ASP.NET Core web framework, keeping up a consistency in the used technologies, ensuring a higher maintainability of all parts of thesource code, 
as well as the ability to use tools developed by Microsoft themselves.
